# VendingMachineKata
A submission of the vending machine kata written in java

The vending machine works by having the user insert coins (done by entering a q/n/d/or p) then selecting a product for purchase.
The user also has the option of choosing not to purchase anything and having their coins returned. Change is calculated and
dispensed in the event of a remainder after a purchase is made and exact change is requested when the vending machine notices it
is incapable of making change with the money on hand.
